# openbdg
This is a Django-powered application that assists in the creation of an organization's Business Data Glossary (BDG).

The project is currently in development. Proposed functionality includes:
- adding glossary entries with associated metadata
- search for glossary entries
- creative filtering
- visualization of glossary items based on data type, date added, data ownership, etc.
